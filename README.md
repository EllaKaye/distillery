Welcome to the distillery: a
[distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) website showcasing other
distill websites and blogs\!

If you have a distill blog, we would love to have it included in this
list\! This is an inclusive community of blogs for everyone to learn
from. Please, add yourself\!

## How to add your distill blog / website to the showcase:

### Method 1

[Open an issue](https://github.com/jhelvy/distillery/issues) and note
your site `name`, the `url` to your site, and url to the `source` code
and we’ll add it to the showcase\!

### Method 2

If you’re comfortable working with pull requests, follow these steps:

1.  Fork this repo.
2.  Add your site to the `sites.csv` in the root directory (include a
    `name`, `url` to the site, and url to the `source`).
3.  Open a pull request to include your changes\!

That’s it\! Your site will be automatically added to the
[showcase](https://jhelvy.github.io/distillery/showcase.html), complete
with a screen shot and the links to the site and source\!
