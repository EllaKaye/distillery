Thanks go to Ma√´lle Salmon - during her session on blogging, for R-Ladies Johannesburg, she used utterances on her teaching site, and also taught us about it.\nAcknowledgements\nI‚Äôd like to make my acknowledgements up front, because this post is just a synthesis of two excellent posts from Ma√´lle Salmon and Miles McBain.\nGoodbye Disqus! Hello, Utterances\nHow I got utteranc.es working on my rmarkdown distill blog\nThis distill issue, was also a big help. Thanks to Taras Kaduk.\nReading their posts will give you the tools you need to have comments on your blog posts using utterances. The below is a summary from these resources.\nutterances\n‚Äúutterances is a comments widget built on GitHub issues‚Äù.\nTo set it up you need to first install the utterances GitHub app, if you have not already done so.\nYou then need to allow the app access to your blog repository (repo) in GitHub. My blog repo is named Blog_Vebash (inspired, eh ü§ê).\n\nIn GitHub, navigate to the Issues tab in your Blog‚Äôs repo, and open the Labels section as highlighted below.\n\nChoose New label to add a label for the issue that will serve as your blog‚Äôs comments. I added mine as:\n\n   comments üí¨\n \n\nHTML File in RStudio Project\nWe need to add an .html file that contains the information for the utterances app. Like Miles did, I named mine utterances.html.\nCreate an utterances.html file as shown below, with your blog repo details in the place of the one noted there. Here is mine, copied nearly directly from Mile‚Äôs.\n ```\n <script>\n   document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function () {\n     if (!/posts/.test(location.pathname)) {\n       return;\n     }\n\n     var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n     script.src = \"https://utteranc.es/client.js\";\n     script.setAttribute(\"repo\", \"sciencificity/Blog_Vebash\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"issue-term\", \"title\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"crossorigin\", \"anonymous\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"label\", \"comments üí¨\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"theme\", \"github-light\");\n\n     /* wait for article to load, append script to article element */\n     var observer = new MutationObserver(function (mutations, observer) {\n       var article = document.querySelector(\"d-article\");\n       if (article) {\n         observer.disconnect();\n         /* HACK: article scroll */\n         article.setAttribute(\"style\", \"overflow-y: hidden\");\n         article.appendChild(script);\n       }\n     });\n\n     observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true });\n   });\n <\/script>\n ```\n\nYou may also follow Taras Kaduk‚Äôs advice and amend the d-article, in the querySelector, to d-appendix, if you want your comments to appear after the appendix, instead of between the article and the appendix.\nPlace utterances.html in your main blog folder.\n\nIn your _site.yml file add the includes part under your output format YAML. Now comments using utterances is available for all your blog posts.\noutput: \n  distill::distill_article:\n    includes:\n      in_header: utterances.html\nSomeone commented üéâ\nTo comment a reader has to log into their GitHub account, and give the utterances app permission.\nWhen a reader comments it opens a comment issue in your Blog‚Äôs GitHub repo via the utterances-bot.\nYou may respond on your blog post directly, or in the GitHub repo‚Äôs Issues page.\nIf you do it on the Issues page, you may also close the issue there.\nAs Ma√´lle remarks the downside is perhaps that your reader needs a GitHub account. I am hopeful this will not be too big of a deterrent for readers. If it is, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out on Twitter - I am interested to hear your opinion.\nHappy {distill} Blogging\nüï∫\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Share: ¬†\n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n",
